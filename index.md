# Tyler Lo's User Page
Hi! I'm **Tyler Lo**, a *UCSD* student graduating in ~~2024~~ 2025. One of the quotes I like to live by is that > You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.
I really like this quote because it tells you to spend time with people that you want to become more like, and to prioritize which relationships are most important to you. It also demonstrates your biases; your parents, teachers, and childhood friends had massive impacts on ther person you've become, and it is up to you to filter through the parts of your personality you gained from your childhood and pick which traits to keep. Everyone's personality is summarized by the trauma they experienced in their childhood, as proven by psychology, and it's not difficult to follow the research done on your type of mental trauma and self correct.
This can pretty much be summarized into a few lines of code for one to follow:
```
if(trait == good) {
    keep;
}
else {
    fix;
}
```

Here is also a [link](ramblythoughts.md) to a bunch of my rambly dark thoughts on psychology and stuff.

## My goals for career development
Currently, I am a 2nd year Computer Science major and Environmental Science minor. I have the eventual goal of working in Climate Tech, using either AI to produce solutions to problems like energy efficiency and water scarcity or a job using data to solve the same issues. However, I have the most experience currently in Front-End.
I wouldn't mind going into Front-End and eventually Full-Stack as a career, but I'm worried about ChatGPT eventually replacing a large portion of this job space, so instead I'm considering specializing in AI as a way to stay competitive in a marketspace that is also filled with too many UI/UX designers, which limits that opportunity.

I have a list of priorities of what I need to do to achieve these goals:
1. Prioritize getting an internship
2. Maintain a relatively stable GPA
3. Learn and begin to make projects using AI/ML

I also have a list of personal goals
- Be carbon negative at the end of my life
- Use logic to make every important decision
- spend the majority of my time with people who are either hard workers or passionate about what they do
### This Quarter

For this quarter, I have a few goals
[ ] work on a website I am currently building for a game called Legends of Runeterra along with other people
[ ] work on a website I'm building for my aunt who owns a travel agency buisness
[ ] eat vegetables and gain a bit of weight <sub>(which are contradictory goals, i know)</sub>
